text "We represent Multi-token assets as a function from Token to natural numbers." 
(*
TODO: decide if we want to change this definition to a (Token \<rightharpoonup> nat) Map with a 
finite domain. This could help if we try to generate code from this theory as this definition yields 
Wellsortedness error (see last dummy section).

The problem that I see with changing the definition is that converting to a Map makes the 0 definition
more complex or some theorems like assetZero not true, as having (\<forall> t. None) is not the same as (asset tok 0).
One way to aliviate that is to also require the asset to be strictly bigger than 0, but is it worth it?
